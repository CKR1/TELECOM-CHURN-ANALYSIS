# TELECOM-CHURN-ANALYSIS


Telecom churn analysis involves examining customer behavior to predict and prevent customer churn, which is when customers stop using a company's services. Here's a basic outline of steps involved in telecom churn analysis:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data such as customer demographics, usage patterns, service subscriptions, billing information, customer service interactions, and churn history.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types. Perform feature engineering to create new variables or transform existing ones that might be more predictive.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data to understand patterns and relationships. Visualize the data using charts and graphs to identify correlations and potential factors influencing churn.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that are highly correlated with churn. This could involve statistical methods, feature importance from machine learning models, or domain knowledge.

Model Building: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data.

Churn Prediction: Use the trained model to predict churn for new customers. This prediction can help prioritize retention efforts and allocate resources effectively.

Actionable Insights: Analyze the model's predictions to gain insights into why customers are churning. Use these insights to develop targeted strategies for customer retention, such as personalized offers, improved customer service, or product enhancements.
